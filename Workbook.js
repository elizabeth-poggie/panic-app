For this reason, we’ve put this section before all other Basic Skills—ideally, you should check-in with your current Self Care and establish new, healthy Self Care habits before attempting any other Basic Skills. You won’t become a world-class skater without first buying a pair of skates—and you wouldn’t get to be very good if those skates were made of wood! Similarly, the Basic Skills and other techniques found in this workbook require a solid foundation; in this case the bedrock of anxiety management is Self Care.",
